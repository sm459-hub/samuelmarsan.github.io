## Sponsor Inclusive Coaching Access

Not everyone can afford private coaching — but that doesn’t mean they don’t deserve support.

Your donation helps cover the cost of coaching sessions for individuals from underserved communities who are navigating complex life challenges but may not qualify for or afford traditional therapy.

---

### Who You’ll Be Supporting

Your contributions help fund coaching for:

- 🎓 **Students and early-career adults** facing financial hardship
- 🧠 **Neurodivergent adults** (e.g., ADHD, autism) seeking structure and self-advocacy skills
- 🌈 **LGBTQ+ youth and young adults** seeking affirming support outside of family therapy settings
- 💸 **Low-income clients** committed to personal growth but unable to meet private-pay rates

---

### Why This Matters

Coaching can offer transformational support — goal setting, executive function tools, identity exploration, emotional regulation — **without requiring a mental health diagnosis** or navigating insurance barriers.

As a doctoral-level clinician-in-training with deep experience in trauma-informed, neurodivergent-affirming, and gender-expansive care, I believe cost should not be a barrier to this kind of help.

### Your Donation Makes a Difference:

- 🕒 **$50** = 30-minute coaching check-in  
- 🗓 **$150** = One full-length session  
- 🌱 **$500** = One-month sponsorship (3–4 sessions + midweek support)  
- ❤️ **Any amount** helps reduce the cost of care for someone in need
