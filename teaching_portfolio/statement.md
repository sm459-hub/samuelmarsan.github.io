# Teaching Statement


I am committed to creating a learning environment where every student—regardless of background, identity, or ability—feels valued, empowered, and equipped to succeed. My intention is to serve students from all diverse perspectives and to view that diversity as a resource, strength, and benefit to our collective learning community. I strive to present materials and activities that are respectful of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, age, religion, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, culture, and neurodiversity, and I welcome suggestions to ensure that our classroom remains supportive and accessible.

Drawing on universal-design principles, I offer multiple ways for students to engage with content—combining visual, auditory, and hands-on experiences—so each learner can choose the mode that works best for them. I embed clear accommodation procedures into every syllabus, guide students through institutional support channels, and model self-advocacy through sharing my own journey as a neurodivergent learner.

In discussion, I co-create norms that honor diverse voices and encourage respectful dialogue; in assessment, I design transparent rubrics and low-stakes reflection prompts that allow students to demonstrate mastery in ways that leverage their strengths. Outside of class, I volunteer in bilingual tutoring programs and guest-lecture in high school and college settings to broaden access to psychology for underrepresented learners.

By continually soliciting feedback—both through mid-semester check-ins and anonymous reflections—I adapt my teaching practices to address emerging needs, reduce barriers, and foster a sense of belonging for all. Together, we build a classroom culture where equity, inclusion, and mutual respect propel every student toward their highest potential.
