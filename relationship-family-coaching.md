## Relationship & Family Coaching

Coaching that centers communication, empathy, and authenticity—supporting individuals, partners, and families navigating life transitions, identity development, and neurodivergent needs.

### Who Is This For?

You may benefit from this coaching if you are:

- A couple working on communication, intimacy, or mutual understanding
- Parents seeking support around a child’s gender identity or neurodivergence
- Adult siblings navigating caregiving or long-standing family dynamics
- Individuals seeking to strengthen boundaries and self-advocacy in relationships
- A family adjusting to a new diagnosis or life change

---

### My Approach

I offer an affirming, non-judgmental space rooted in:

- Trauma-informed coaching strategies
- Neurodiversity-affirming and gender-expansive perspectives
- Attachment theory and systems-based approaches
- Emphasis on lived experience, emotion regulation, and strengths-building

### Important Notes

This is **not** family therapy. While informed by psychological theory, relationship coaching does not provide diagnoses or treat mental health conditions. I’m happy to collaborate with therapists as needed.
