## Relationship & Family Coaching

Coaching that centers communication, empathy, and authenticity—supporting individuals, partners, and families navigating life transitions, identity development, and neurodivergent needs.

### Who Is This For?

You may benefit from this coaching if you are:

- A couple working on communication, intimacy, or mutual understanding
- Parents seeking support around a child’s gender identity or neurodivergence
- Adult siblings navigating caregiving or long-standing family dynamics
- Individuals seeking to strengthen boundaries and self-advocacy in relationships
- A family adjusting to a new diagnosis or life change

---

### My Approach

I offer an affirming, non-judgmental space rooted in:

- Trauma-informed coaching strategies
- Neurodiversity-affirming and gender-expansive perspectives
- Attachment theory and systems-based approaches
- Emphasis on lived experience, emotion regulation, and strengths-building

---

### Focus Areas

- Communication & active listening
- Navigating neurodivergence in relationships (e.g., ADHD, autism)
- LGBTQIA+ and gender-affirming family support
- Breaking unhelpful cycles or legacy burdens
- Psychoeducation around behavior, development, and change
- Value-aligned boundary setting and co-regulation strategies

---

### Session Format

- Individual, couple, or family coaching
- Sessions typically 50–60 minutes
- Virtual delivery with optional asynchronous resources
- Short-term packages or ongoing coaching relationships

### Pricing

Sessions are private-pay only. Visit [Rates & Packages](/rates-and-packages/) for current rates, sliding scale options, and bundled programs.

### Important Notes

This is **not** family therapy. While informed by psychological theory, relationship coaching does not provide diagnoses or treat mental health conditions. I’m happy to collaborate with therapists as needed.
