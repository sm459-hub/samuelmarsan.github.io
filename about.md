## Samuel MarsÃ¡n PÃ©rez, M.A.

I am a bilingual (Englishâ€“Spanish) clinical psychology professional with specialized training in multicultural mental health, gender diversity, eating disorders, and autism spectrum conditions. My academic foundation includes an M.A. in Clinical Psychology from Duke University, a predoctoral internship at the University of Texas, a B.S. from UNC Chapel Hill, and an A.A. from the Honors College Dual Language Program at Miami Dade College.

My professional identity is rooted in both research and direct clinical practice, with a commitment to evidence-based, inclusive care. I bring experience working in interdisciplinary teams, delivering psychotherapy in English and Spanish, and engaging with diverse communities across the U.S. and Latin America.

My interests include:
- Health equity and access for historically underserved groups
- Gender-affirming care for adolescents and young adults
- Measurement development in psychological assessment
- Culturally responsive clinical research

I am currently seeking roles that align with my dedication to culturally attuned, empirically supported mental health services.
