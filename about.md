# About Me

![Headshot of Samuel Marsan](/assets/headshot.jpg){: style="max-width: 200px; border-radius: 100px; margin-bottom: 1rem;" }

I am a bilingual (Englishâ€“Spanish) clinical psychology professional with specialized training in transgender health, eating disorders, autism spectrum conditions, and multicultural mental health. My clinical and academic path has been shaped by a deep commitment to inclusive, evidence-based practice and a strong foundation in culturally responsive care.

My academic training includes a Masterâ€™s degree in Clinical Psychology from **Duke University**, a predoctoral internship in Clinical Psychology at the **University of Texas Health Science Center**, and a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from **UNC-Chapel Hill**. Prior to that, I completed dual degrees at **Miami Dade College Honors College**, where I participated in a Spanish-English dual language program with a focus on interdisciplinary scholarship.

Over the past several years, I have engaged in psychotherapy, assessment, and research with a diverse range of populations in academic medical centers, university counseling clinics, and community health settings. My clinical work has emphasized adolescent mental health, gender-diverse youth, and evidence-based interventions for anxiety, mood, and eating disorders. My research complements this work, focusing on the development of psychometric tools that more accurately capture the lived experience of marginalized populations.

I am especially interested in the intersection of cultural identity, embodiment, and mental health outcomes. My masterâ€™s thesis and dissertation research have focused on improving measurement tools to assess body image and quality of life in transgender adolescents.

I am currently open to roles that integrate clinical practice, research, and trainingâ€”particularly those that align with values of health equity, linguistic and cultural inclusion, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
