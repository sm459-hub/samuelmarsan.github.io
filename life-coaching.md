Life coaching provides structured, future-focused support to help clients clarify goals, navigate life transitions, and build meaningful, values-aligned routines. Unlike therapy, life coaching does not treat mental health conditions but offers accountability and strategies for thriving in personal and professional domains.

## Who This Is For

This service is ideal for:

- Adults seeking clarity during a career, relationship, or life transition
- Neurodivergent individuals aiming to build routines and confidence
- Emerging professionals navigating identity, values, and ambition
- Individuals pursuing fulfillment, balance, or creativity

## What We Focus On

- Goal setting and strategic planning
- Motivation, mindset, and habit change
- Building sustainable routines and self-advocacy skills
- Enhancing emotional awareness and resilience
- Exploring personal values and purpose

## What You Can Expect

Sessions are supportive, affirming, and evidence-informed. As a doctoral-level clinician with advanced training in cognitive-behavioral, motivational, and trauma-informed approaches, I offer guidance that is structured yet flexible to your needs.

> _“Life coaching allows us to co-create a path forward. We define success on your terms.”_

## Coaching Format

- Sessions typically 50 minutes via secure video conferencing
- Packages available for 4, 8, or 12 sessions
- Sliding scale available for those with financial need

For those with intersecting identities—such as neurodivergence, multilingual backgrounds, or LGBTQIA+ identity—coaching will always affirm and celebrate your lived experience.
