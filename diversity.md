I am deeply committed to cultivating a coaching space where all clients—across identities, backgrounds, and lived experiences—feel genuinely seen, affirmed, and empowered. As a bilingual, neurodivergent clinician and researcher trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Relational Frame Theory (RFT), I ground my coaching in both psychosocial theory and evidence-based practice, drawing from frameworks that validate complexity and foster adaptive change.

My commitment to diversity is anchored in years of direct service with underrepresented communities—LGBTQ+ youth, Spanish-speaking families, autistic adults, and individuals navigating intersecting marginalizations. Across clinical and academic settings, I have supported clients and research participants through trauma-informed, affirming, and culturally responsive interventions. From parent coaching groups in Spanish to gender-focused cognitive interventions in English, I adapt my methods to meet clients’ linguistic, cultural, and neurocognitive needs.

I approach coaching as a collaborative, values-driven process that integrates lived experience with behavioral science. Whether supporting identity development, emotion regulation, or professional transitions, I draw from my training in self-determination theory, mindfulness-based protocols, and contextual behavioral science to center dignity, autonomy, and empowerment.

I view diversity not as a static trait, but as a dynamic asset in our coaching work. I engage in regular anti-oppressive training, reflective supervision, and consultation with multicultural and gender-specialty teams. My doctoral research—focused on embodiment and body image among transgender youth—has taught me to ask deeper questions about systemic inclusion, access, and justice in psychological frameworks. I bring that same curiosity and responsibility to my coaching relationships.

As I expand my coaching practice, I remain committed to:
- Offering coaching in English and Spanish
- Prioritizing access through flexible formats and universal design
- Co-creating safe and accountable coaching agreements
- Soliciting regular feedback to identify and dismantle emerging barriers

Together, we’ll build a coaching partnership where your lived wisdom is honored, your values are the compass, and your growth is sustained through evidence-aligned, equity-centered care.
