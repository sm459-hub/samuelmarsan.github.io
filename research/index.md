# Research

My research explores how gender identity, embodiment, and sociocultural factors shape psychological well-being, particularly in LGBTQ+ youth. Drawing on clinical psychology, developmental science, and community-engaged methodologies, I focus on body image, resilience, and measurement design. My goal is to support affirming interventions through evidence-based insights and inclusive instruments.
