# Gender Identity Exploration Coaching

Exploring your gender identity or seeking to live more authentically? I provide **affirming and intersectional coaching** for individuals and families navigating gender identity, transition, or gender expression.

## What Is Gender Identity Coaching?

Gender coaching creates a nonjudgmental space for:
- Exploring identity and expression
- Building confidence in your authentic self
- Navigating social, medical, or family-related transitions
- Educating and involving family or support systems

This is not therapy. It is goal-oriented support grounded in clinical training and personal respect.

## Who Might Benefit?

- Teens or adults exploring gender identity or dysphoria
- Parents or caregivers of gender-diverse youth
- Nonbinary, trans, or questioning individuals seeking support
- Neurodivergent individuals navigating gender discovery

## My Background

I draw from:
- Specialized training in **gender-affirming care**
- Research experience with **trans youth and families**
- Clinical work in **gender clinics and neurodivergent communities**

My goal is to support your unique journey with warmth, knowledge, and integrity.

## Sample Topics

- Identity and embodiment goals
- Planning for social transition
- Communicating with loved ones
- Coping with minority stress
- Self-care and confidence building
- Navigating systems (school, healthcare, legal)
