# Executive Functioning Coaching

Do you struggle with planning, organizing, staying focused, or managing time effectively? I offer **neurodiversity-affirming executive functioning coaching** to help teens, adults, and professionals strengthen the skills needed for personal, academic, and professional success.

## What Is Executive Function Coaching?

Executive functions are cognitive processes that help you:
- Set goals and plan effectively
- Stay organized and manage time
- Sustain attention and task initiation
- Regulate emotions and build routines

This coaching focuses on building those skills using practical tools, collaborative goal-setting, and supportive accountability.

## Who Is This For?

- Neurodivergent individuals (e.g., ADHD, autism)
- High school and college students
- Graduate students and postdocs
- Working professionals and parents
- Adults navigating career or life transitions

## Coaching Methods

My approach is:
- **Evidence-informed**, drawing from CBT, motivational interviewing, and behavior tracking
- **Trauma-informed**, respecting past experiences that impact focus or self-esteem
- **Strength-based**, supporting self-advocacy and confidence-building

I bring extensive training from clinical and academic settings (Duke University, UTHealth) in coaching students and adults across neurotypes and cultural identities.

## Sample Topics

- Weekly planning and scheduling
- Reducing screen time and digital distractions
- Emotional regulation tools
- Prioritizing tasks and breaking them into steps
- Creating systems for motivation and follow-through

## Packages & Rates
