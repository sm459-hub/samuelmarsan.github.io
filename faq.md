### How is coaching different from psychotherapy or psychiatry?

**Coaching** is a collaborative, goal-focused relationship that supports skill-building, life planning, and personal growth. Unlike therapy or psychiatry:

- **No diagnosis is needed** — you can seek coaching for personal development without qualifying for a mental health disorder.
- **It’s future-oriented** — coaching focuses on where you want to go, not just where you’ve been.
- **It’s de-stigmatizing** — there are no medical labels or insurance records attached to coaching services.

By contrast:

- **Psychotherapy** treats diagnosable mental health conditions and may explore trauma or emotional pain.
- **Psychiatry** centers on medical evaluation and often medication management. It may be essential for some, but not all clients want or benefit from that model.

### Why do clients choose coaching over therapy or psychiatry?

Some clients prefer coaching because:

- **They want support without a clinical diagnosis**
- **They value skill-building more than symptom management**
- **They’re skeptical of over-medicalization and dependency on medication**
- **They appreciate the proactive, strengths-based nature of coaching**

Coaching may be especially appealing to:

- People who want to avoid psychiatric diagnoses for privacy or cultural reasons
- Neurodivergent adults (e.g., ADHD, autism) who benefit from structure, not pathologization
- Clients from LGBTQ+ and culturally diverse backgrounds seeking affirming, identity-informed support
- Individuals seeking a male-identified coach who understands men’s experiences and emotional health

### What are your coaching rates?

Rates vary depending on the type and length of service. Typical options include:

- **Standard 50-minute session**: $150–$250
- **Sliding-scale sessions**: Available upon request for those with financial need
- **Immersive coaching days or packages**: Starting at $1,500+

Each session includes individualized attention, preparation, and follow-up support.

### Do you accept insurance?

No, coaching services are **not covered by insurance**. This helps ensure:

- Greater **confidentiality** (no medical records or diagnostic codes shared)
- More **flexibility** in session structure and goals
- More time spent **working directly with clients**, not navigating red tape

Many clients find coaching to be a **worthwhile investment in long-term growth**, especially compared to the limitations of insurance-based care.

### Who trained you in coaching-related practices?

While not a traditional coaching certification, my background in **clinical psychology** and extensive practicum training forms the foundation of my coaching:

- **Nancy Zucker, PhD** — Clinical supervision in eating disorders, family therapy, and Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT)
- **Jill Howard, PhD & Katherine Loveland, PhD** — Training in autism across the lifespan and family systems
- **Chris Mauro, PhD** — Experience in clinical trials and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
- **Geraldine Dawson, PhD** — Developmental psychology and translational autism methods, including the Early Start Denver Model

This training shapes my approach to **neurodivergent-affirming**, **evidence-based**, and **identity-informed** coaching that addresses real-life challenges in personalized ways.
