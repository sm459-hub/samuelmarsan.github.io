## Support Psychosocial Aid for Elderly Adults in Cuba 🇨🇺

In Cuba, many elderly adults face heartbreaking challenges: loneliness, hunger, extreme heat without air conditioning, and deep feelings of helplessness. Your donation helps provide psychosocial support and basic relief for elders who are often forgotten.

### Who You’ll Be Helping

- 🧓 Elders living alone with **limited mobility** or vision  
- 🍽 Seniors struggling with **hunger and poor nutrition**  
- 🔥 Adults suffering from the **heat** without air conditioning or fans  
- 💔 Empty-nest elders experiencing **depression, grief, and isolation**

---

### What Your Donation Supports

Your donation helps provide:

- 🎒 Basic goods (food, fans, medications, water filters)
- 🧠 Psychosocial support via phone, messaging, or community visits
- 🤝 Connection and care from someone who listens and helps

This grassroots aid is not part of any large NGO. Donations go directly toward **human-to-human support** for vulnerable elderly adults, distributed through trusted local partners and contacts.
